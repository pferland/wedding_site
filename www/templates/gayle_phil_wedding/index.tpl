								It all started with perfect timing. Phillip and Gayle arrived at their
								first date at the same moment, and two very nervous people did not have
								enough time to be concerned. After talking so much the waiter got annoyed,
								they both knew something special was bound to happen. Bonding over a
								shared sense of humor, general geekiness, and love of travel and food, Gayle
								will become Phillip&#39;s permanent Sous Chef.
								<br>
								After many cheese plates and adventures, they both knew it was forever.
								Now, two best friends can&#39;t wait to spend their lives together.
								<br>
								Hope to see you at the wedding!
